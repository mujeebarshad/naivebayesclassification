# Naive Bayes Classification

This is the implementation of NaiveBayes and ID3 to generate report on Mushroom Database.
It is implemented without the use of any python library with original mathematical technique:

Functions implemented in these program are:

For ID3:
1. Class Node
2. findEntropy()
3. AttributedEntropy()
4. reduceTable()
5. showTable()

For NaiveBayes
1. getColumn()
2. getEachColumnProbabilty()
3. getAttributeIndex()
4. checkAccuracy()
